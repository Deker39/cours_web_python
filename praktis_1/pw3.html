        <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
        <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
        <div class="cont-formula"> 
            <p class="formula">ax + b = 0</p> 
        </div>
        <p>where <span>a</span>  and <span>b</span>  are real numbers and <span>x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear
            equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not
            be an x so don't get too locked into always seeing an <span>x</span> there.</p>
        <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>
        <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
        <div class="cont-formula">
            <p class="formula"> ax<sup>2</sup>  + bx + c = 0 </p>
        </div>
        <p>where <span>a, b, c</span> are known values and <span>x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span>a</span> can't be 0.
        </p>
        <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>
        <p><span> &#960;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span>r</span>) squared:</p>
        <div class="cont-formula">
            <p class="formula">A = &#960; &#215; r<sup>2</sup>   </p>
        </div>
        <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span>D</span>):</p>
        <div class="cont-formula">
            <p class="formula">A = (&#960; / 4) &#215; D<sup>2</sup></p>
        </div>
        <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span>C</span>):</p>
        <div class="cont-formula">
            <p class="formula">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &#215; &#960; </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Intersection</h3>
        <p>The intersection of two sets <span>A</span>  and <span>B</span>, denoted by A [sign] B, is the set of all objects that are members of
            both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
            <div class="cont-formula">
                <p class="formula"> A &#8745; B = { x : x 	&#8712; A and x &#8712; B } </p>
            </div>
        <p>That is, <span>x</span> is an element of the intersection A &#8745; B if and only if <span>x</span> is both an element 
            of <span>A</span> and an element of <span>B</span>.</p>

    </div>
